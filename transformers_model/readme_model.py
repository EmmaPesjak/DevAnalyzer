## Key Features
üèÅ **High performance:** exceptional speed, outperforming alternatives like SQLite and Realm in all CRUD operations.\
üíö **Efficient Resource Usage:** minimal CPU, power and memory consumption for maximum flexibility and sustainability.\
üîó **[Built-in Object Relations](https://docs.objectbox.io/relations):** built-in support for object relations, allowing you to easily establish and manage relationships between objects.\
üëå **Ease of use:** concise API that eliminates the need for complex SQL queries, saving you time and effort during development.
## Why use ObjectBox for Java data management?

ObjectBox is a NoSQL Java database designed for local data storage on resource-restricted devices, prioritizing 
offline-first functionality. It is a smart and sustainable choice for local data persistence in Java and Kotlin 
applications. It offers efficiency, ease of use, and flexibility.

### Fast but resourceful
Optimized for speed and minimal resource consumption, ObjectBox is an ideal solution for mobile devices. It has 
excellent performance, while also minimizing CPU, RAM, and power usage. ObjectBox outperforms SQLite and Realm across 
all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Check out our [Performance Benchmarking App repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-performance).

### Simple but powerful
With its concise language-native API, ObjectBox simplifies development by requiring less code compared to SQLite. It 
operates on plain objects (POJOs) with built-in relations, eliminating the need to manage rows and columns. This 
approach is efficient for handling large data volumes and allows for easy model modifications.

### Functionality

üíê **[Queries](https://docs.objectbox.io/queries):** filter data as needed, even across relations\
üíª **[Multiplatform](https://docs.objectbox.io/faq#on-which-platforms-does-objectbox-run):** supports Android and JVM on Linux (also on ARM), Windows and macOS\
üå± **Scalable:** handling millions of objects resource-efficiently with ease\
ü¶Æ **Statically typed:** compile time checks & optimizations\
üìÉ **Automatic schema migrations:** no update scripts needed

**And much more than just data persistence**\
üîÑ **[ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/):** keeps data in sync between devices and servers\
üïí **[ObjectBox TS](https://objectbox.io/time-series-database/):** time series extension for time based data

# do_sample controls whether the model should sample multiple times,
