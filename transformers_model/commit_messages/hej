"Perfective
This activity refers to changes that do not reflect the functional behavior of a software. It includes design, performance improvements and
other non functional requirements. These activities aim at improving
program structure (e.g., renaming or moving entities, pushing down
attributes, code clean up, etc.) and system’s efficiency (e.g., improving
algorithms, choosing more efficient data structures or library routines,
and operating system tuning)." OBS DETTA ÄR DIREKT CITERAT FRÅN RODIS ARTIKEL

"3.1.1. Corrective
This is a corrective activity that includes fixing all types of possible
problems (e.g., bugs, faults, defects, etc.). A bug is an error in the
program, that causes the program to behave not as it was intended
by the developer. Bugs can be classified into major or minor bugs
according to their severity and their impact on the system. OBS DETTA ÄR DIREKT CITERAT FRÅN RODIS ARTIKEL
3.1.2. Adaptive
It is a functional activity where changes are made to adapt the
software to new environments, platforms and software dependencies.
Sometimes, adaptive changes reflect organizational policies or rules as
well." OBS DETTA ÄR DIREKT CITERAT FRÅN RODIS ARTIKEL
